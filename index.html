								<p>A little bit about myself I was raised in California and grew up interested in mathematics. During middle school, this combined with my passion for video games led to explore many other possibilities of the computer, such as cryptocurrency, cryptography, penetration testing, and game design. As I went through high school, I learned many of the basics of multiple programming languages, including Java, Javascript, Python, and CSS. I would then join SkillsUSA to take part in the Game Design event where I would learn the fundamentals of C# and how it was used in Unity.</p>
								<p>I was then accepted into UCI where I would major in Software Engineering as my interest in Computer Science had grown and I am currently working on projects related to Full-Stack development. Some of which you can check out <a href="#work">here</a>.</p>
								<p>I am Korean and grew up within a Korean household, so I can speak fluently in Korean, am a Native speaker of English and a bit of Spanish as well</p>

								<h2 class="major">Work</h2>

								<p>My first job was part-time at a Sushi place in Riverside called <a href="https://www.ohanasushica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ohana Sushi</a>, as a waiter, I learned how to communicate with customers and coworkers. It was here that I first experienced working in a fast-paced environment</p>
								<p>My next job was working part-time at a Poke place also in Riverside named <a href="https://www.ilovepokebar.com/locations/riverside" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poke Bar</a>, I was a server there and gained lots of experience with customer service while I was saving up funds to help for my tuition</p>
								<p>My most recent job was working online as a Math Tutor with a company called <a href="https://www.imathacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Interactive Math Academy</a>, I learned how to efficiently provide information to others and how to use references to help others gain a better understanding</p>

								<p>This is a mobile app I made with react-native and Firebase, I liked the idea of having public chat rooms and would be a great private app for a personalized group</p>

								<p>My first web project is an expense tracker that simply takes input data from the user with webhooks and stores it to a database and manipulates it with user commands. I utilized react-native, webhooks and MongoDB while making this app.</p>
